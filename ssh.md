Secure shell is a common term often used when studying computer networks. In simple terms, **SSH secure shell refers to a secured network protocol that helps access remote computers securely in a network. However, it is much more complicated than it sounds.**

> So in this blog, we will study all about secure shell protocol. Also, we will explore its working, its concepts, and the mechanisms it leverages for safe remote access. Let us start!

### What is a Secure Shell?

**SSH** in computer networks refers to a remote administration protocol that enables users, especially system administrators, to access, manage, and modify the remote servers over an unsecured network.

**SSH** facilitates public key authentication and strong password authentication for servers. It is also used to communicate between two computers that use encrypted data over an open network or the internet.

Additionally, system administrators widely use secure shells to log in to a different computer system over a network. They utilize it to execute commands and transfer files from one system to another.

**SSH** is a common term used both for cryptographic network protocol and the suite of utilities that implement the protocol. Secure shell usually leverages a client-server model that connects an SSH secure shell client application to an SSH server.

SSH is a highly versatile protocol and can also be used to build secure tunnels for other application protocols.
