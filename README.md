### What is SSH? A Beginner's guide to Secure SSH
- A Secure Shell, or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that allows devices to achieve two important things: communicate and share data. Additionally, the SSH protocol also encrypts data, making it ideal for unsecured networks.

### How Does it Work?


As a term, Secure Socket Shell, defines both a cryptographic network protocol and the programs that enable it to work.

> SSH enables network administrators to access a computer via an unsecured network in a safe manner. It ensures a secure connection that allows it to operate and manage remote computers without worrying about the safety of shared data.  

To achieve this, the SSH protocol does not only provide encryption with the help of a secure channel but also strong password authentication and public-key authentication.

The SSH protocol and SSH keys – access credentials within the protocol – secure millions of file transfers, automated functions and upkeep sessions per day.
